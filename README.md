Pulse photodetection and electrocardiography. Submitted April 25, 2017.

<h1>Abstract</h1>

The purpose of this project was to create a functioning pulse measurement device by combining the capabilities of a pulse oximeter and an electrocardiogram test (ECG) along with an Arduino Uno board and readily accessible software. A pulse oximeter attaches to a
fingertip and correlates the tissue’s light response to the amount of oxygenated blood reaching the finger at a given point in time. An ECG measures and graphs the electrical activity associated with the conductive system within the heart. Together, these two
measurements allow for the calibration of the beats-per-minute measurement. A holistic evaluation of the project’s development reveal various successes and flaws in the final product. In addition, the device has been verified to work within the limits of normal resting heart rates for healthy human subjects, and uncertainty levels remain in acceptable limits when adequate sampling intervals are taken.
